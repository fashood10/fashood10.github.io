:: Agree to go out with him and see where it leads {"position":"675,900","size":"100,100"}
You decide to go ahead and agree to go out with him and see where it leads. After all, you've come this far, and you want to see if he really falls for your catfishing or if he's just playing along.

You set up a date and time to meet him at a local bar. When you arrive, he's already there, sipping on a cocktail. He stands up when he sees you and smiles, making your heart skip a beat.

As the night goes on, you can feel yourself starting to like him. He's funny, charming, and easy to talk to. But then he starts to ask questions about your friend, and you realize that you can't keep the charade up any longer.

You come clean about catfishing him and using your friend's photos. He's understandably upset, and you feel terrible.

In the end, you lose both Jack and your friend. She finds out about what you did, and she can't forgive you for it. You're left feeling alone and regretful, realizing that your actions had bigger consequences than you had ever imagined.

You decide to play it cool and keep pretending like you don't know who he is. "Hmmm, interesting. Well, I'm not really sure. Maybe we've just got doppelgangers out there."

Jack laughs, seeming to take it in stride. "Yeah, I guess maybe that's it. So, do you want to grab a drink sometime and see if we can solve this mystery together?"

You pause for a moment, considering your options. Do you want to take things further and potentially hurt him, or do you want to come clean now and spare both of you the embarrassment and pain?

Jack seems eager to keep the conversation going. "Well, you have the same smile as my ex. And the same eyes. And, well, pretty much everything else. Are you sure we haven't met before?"

You can feel yourself getting excited. This is exactly what you wanted - to see if he still had feelings for your friend, and if he would fall for your catfishing scheme. You decide to push it a little further.

There's a long pause before Jack responds. "Oh. Well, in that case, can you tell her I said hi? And that I hope she's doing well?"

You can't help but feel disappointed. This wasn't the reaction you were hoping for. You had wanted to see if he still had feelings for your friend, and if he would fall for your catfishing scheme. But now you realize that you don't want to hurt him, or your friend, anymore.
